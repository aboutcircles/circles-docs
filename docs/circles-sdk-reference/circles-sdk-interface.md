# Circles SDK interface

The Circles SDK provides a high-level interface for interacting with the Circles protocol, focusing on features like user profiles, avatars, token transfers, and contract interactions. It integrates with Circles V1 and V2 hubs, and enables registration, migration, and management of avatars and profiles.

## **Class: `Sdk`**

This class implements the `SdkInterface`, which provides core functionality to interact with the Circles protocol.

The `Sdk` class implements the following interface:

```typescript
import { Avatar } from './avatar';
import { CirclesConfig } from './circlesConfig';
import { V1Pathfinder } from './v1/pathfinderV1';
import { AvatarInterface } from './AvatarInterface';

import { CMGroupDeployer, BaseGroupFactory, DemurrageCircles, Hub as HubV2, InflationaryCircles, NameRegistry } from '@circles-sdk/abi-v2';
import { AvatarRow, CirclesData, CirclesRpc } from '@circles-sdk/data';
import { Address } from '@circles-sdk/utils';
import { GroupProfile, Profile, Profiles } from '@circles-sdk/profiles';
import { ContractTransactionReceipt } from 'ethers';

### **Constructor**

```typescript
constructor(contractRunner: SdkContractRunner, config?: CirclesConfig)
```

* **Parameters**:
  * `contractRunner`: An instance of `SdkContractRunner`, which is responsible for signing transactions.
  * `config`: Optional, an instance of `CirclesConfig`, containing chain-specific configurations (addresses and endpoints).



## **Additional Modules Used**

* `Avatar`: Represents the Circles avatar with methods for interacting with its state.
* `CirclesConfig`: Holds chain-specific configurations such as contract addresses and RPC endpoints.
* `Pathfinder`: Provides routing for token transfers on the Circles network.
* `Profiles`: Manages avatar profiles within Circles.
* `ContractTransactionReceipt`: Used to manage transactions and their receipts on the Ethereum blockchain.
