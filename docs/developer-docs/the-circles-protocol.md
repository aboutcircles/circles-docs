# â­• The Circles Protocol

## Building on the Circles protocol <a href="#using-circles-as-a-developer" id="using-circles-as-a-developer"></a>

As a developer, you have the opportunity to contribute to this transformative initiative. Our developer documentation portal provides comprehensive guides, API references, and code examples to help you integrate Circles into your applications and build upon our ecosystem.



### Protocol Architecture

At its core, the Circles Protocol is built on decentralized technologies such as blockchain and cryptographic primitives. Here's a high-level overview of its architecture:

* **Blockchain Layer:** Circles utilizes a blockchain as the underlying infrastructure for transaction validation and consensus. Gnosis Chain is currently the primary blockchain used, providing a secure and decentralized ledger for recording Circles transactions.
* **Smart Contracts:** Smart contracts play a crucial role in the Circles Protocol, facilitating the creation and management of Circles currencies, as well as the execution of trust-based transactions. These contracts define the rules and logic governing Circles interactions, ensuring transparency and immutability.
* **Identity and Trust Graph:** Within the Circles ecosystem, users establish trust relationships with one another, forming a dynamic graph of trust connections. This trust graph enables secure value transfer between trusted parties, fostering a decentralized network of economic collaboration.

### Using the SDK

To integrate Circles into your applications, you can leverage the Circles Software Development Kit (SDK), which provides a set of tools and libraries for interacting with the protocol. Here's what you can do with the SDK:

* **Create circles user account and manage CRCs:** The SDK allows you to programmatically sign up as Circles user, trust new users and allows to manage CRC tokens for use-cases.
* **Execute Transactions:** You can use the SDK to execute trust-based transactions within Circles networks, transferring value between trusted individuals based on established trust connections.
* **Interact with Smart Contracts:** The SDK provides interfaces for interacting with Circles smart contracts deployed on the blockchain, enabling seamless integration of Circles functionality into your applications.

### Contributing to the Protocol

As a developer, you have the opportunity to contribute to the evolution of the Circles Protocol by:

* **Building Applications:** Develop innovative blockchain applications, use-cases, proof of concepts that leverage Circles for decentralized value exchange, community building, and economic collaboration.
* **Improving the SDK:** Contribute to the development of the Circles SDK by submitting code contributions, bug fixes, and feature enhancements to enhance its usability and functionality.
* **Research and Development:** Explore new ideas and approaches for enhancing the scalability, privacy, and interoperability of the Circles Protocol through research and development initiatives.
