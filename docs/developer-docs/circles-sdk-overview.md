# üó∫Ô∏è Circles SDK Overview

The [Circles SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@circles-sdk/sdk) is a TypeScript library that allows you to integrate Circles into your dApp.&#x20;

With the SDK, you can register a wallet as a human, organization, or group. Registered wallets, called `Avatars`, participate in the Circles trust graph and transact with other Circles Avatars.\
\
Additionally, you can use the SDK to query the Circles trust graph, balances, and transaction data, as well as subscribe to protocol events.

There are SDK example applications available for Svelte and React.
