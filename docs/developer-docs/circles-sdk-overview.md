# ðŸ”Ž Circles SDK Overview

The [Circles SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@circles-sdk/sdk) is a TypeScript library that allows you to integrate Circles into your dApp.&#x20;

With the SDK, you can register a wallet as a human, organization, or group. Registered wallets, called Avatars, participate in the Circles trust graph and transact with other Circles Avatars.\
\
Additionally, you can use the SDK to query the Circles trust graph, balances, and transaction data, as well as subscribe to protocol events.

There are example application available for:

* [Svelte](https://github.com/aboutcircles/circles-sdk-svelte-examples)
* [React](https://github.com/vanshika-srivastava/circles-vite-app)

The next section will guide you on how to initialize the SDK and provide a step-by-step guide to using different features. If you have any questions at any point while integrating, you can hop onto our Discord server.
