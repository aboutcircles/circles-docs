# üó∫Ô∏è Circles SDK Overview

The [Circles SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@circles-sdk/sdk) is a TypeScript library that allows you to integrate Circles into your dApp.&#x20;

With the SDK, you can register a wallet as a human, organization, or group. Registered wallets, called Avatars, participate in the Circles trust graph and transact with other Circles Avatars.\
\
Additionally, you can use the SDK to query the Circles trust graph, balances, and transaction data, as well as subscribe to protocol events.

There are SDK example application available for Svelte and React.

* Svelte:
  * [circles-sdk-svelte-examples](https://github.com/aboutcircles/circles-sdk-svelte-examples) - A very bare bones svelte application. Contains examples that accompany this SDK guide (v1 only).
  * [5ecret-garden](https://github.com/aboutcircles/5ecret-garden) - Also a very bare bones, yet fully featured Circles client with support for Circles v1 and v2 built around the SDK.
* React:
  * [circles-vite-app](https://github.com/vanshika-srivastava/circles-vite-app) - Similar to the basic svelte app but in React.

The next section will guide you on how to initialize the SDK and provide a step-by-step guide to using different features. If you have any questions at any point while integrating, you can hop onto our Discord server.
