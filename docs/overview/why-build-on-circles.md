# üõ†Ô∏è Why Build on Circles?

Circles offers a fair and community-driven approach to digital currency, addressing common challenges in traditional cryptocurrencies and promoting an inclusive economy. Circles is not a crypto startup; it is collectively brought forward by its ambassadors and community members, who drive its adoption and utility.

By building on Circles, you can give your dApp some unique properties:

**Equal Opportunity for All:** Each user generates tokens continuously at a rate of one Circle (CRC) per hour, ensuring equal opportunity regardless of when they join. This promotes fairness as everyone has a chance to accumulate Circles.

**Community-Driven Trust:** Circles operates on a trust-based model, forming a social graph where users trust each other's CRC tokens. Trusted tokens become fungible, creating a dynamic economy backed by genuine social connections.

**Encouraging Spending**: Circles integrates a demurrage mechanism, applying a 7% annual fee on held tokens. This keeps the currency circulating, benefiting the overall economy and promoting continuous engagement within the community. For most human users, the fee is offset by the steady income of 1 CRC per hour. Organizations always have to pay the fee.

**Fair and Inclusive**: By decentralising the verification process and leveraging human judgement for trust, Circles addresses the issue of fake accounts. This fosters a secure and resilient ecosystem, where the authenticity of each user is ensured by their social connections rather than centralised authorities or algorithms.

**Support for Group Currencies:** Circles v2 allows for the creation of group currencies, enabling communities to share a currency that's backed by their members personal tokens. This reduces risk, simplifies payments, and enhances market creation by aggregating individual tokens into a more stable group currency that's easy to integrate in existing protocols.

By joining the Circles developer community, you can play a crucial role in building a more equitable and inclusive financial system.
