# üõ†Ô∏è Why Build on Circles?

As a developer, you have the opportunity to contribute to the Circles initiative. Our developer documentation portal provides guides and code examples to help you integrate Circles into your applications and build upon the ecosystem.

1. **Permission-less and decentralised**: Circles are distributed automatically and equally to all participants, and without a central issuer, ensuring a fair and reliable distribution.
2. **Trust-based network**: The Circles network is built on trust and a shared goal of financial empowerment, enabling seamless and secure transactions between participants.
3. **Scalable architecture**: Our system is designed to handle a growing number of participants and transactions, ensuring the long-term sustainability of the project.
4. **Open-source development**: As Circles custodians and ambassadors, we embrace open-source principles and encourage developers to contribute to the project to help shape the future of Circles.

By joining the Circles developer community, you can play a crucial role in building a more equitable and inclusive financial system.

Explore our developer documentation, dive into the codebase, and join us in our mission to create a fair and sustainable economy for all.
