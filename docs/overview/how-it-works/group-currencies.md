# Group Currencies

In addition to individual CRC currencies, Circles has introduced the concept of Group Currencies to allow users to aggregate individual Circles tokens and combine them into a shared single (group) token, enhancing functionality and utility. This allows for the formation of sub-communities with shared economic interests or goals within the larger Circles network​​.
