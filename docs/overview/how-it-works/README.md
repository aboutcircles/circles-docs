# ⚡ How It Works

Circles is a unique system that consists of individual personal currencies functioning together to create a unified monetary system. Tying the currency to time, Circles allows for a new way of valuing labour, skills and contributions.

1. When someone joins Circles, the contract creates a unique “personal currency” which is distributed to each person at a rate of 24 Circles (CRC) per day.
2. As a result, every hour, each individual person who has signed up for Circles will have one Circle added to their account.
3. Everyone has the option and is encouraged to 'trust' the personal Circles of others, which means accepting these Circles in transactions.
4. This trust mechanism leads to the formation of a “social graph”, where money is interconnected through mutual trust between people.
5. The trust-based model encourages genuine connections and community networks, as the value of a person's individual currency is tied to their trusted relationships in the system.
