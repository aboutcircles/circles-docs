# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Circles

Circles is a vision for and a project to implement a social money that is collaborative, rather than comptetitive in its nature. At the core of the Circles project lies a simple yet powerful principle:

**"Every person receives one Circle every hour, unconditionally."**

Circles uses smart contracts to facilitate this social contract between people and help it scale across communities.
